# codegolf

A set of public coding exercises I do to warm up my brain.

Routines are at the center of our practice. [The Power of Habit]() describes the benefit of a specific kind of behavior:

>A `keystone habit` is an individual pattern that is unintentionally capable of triggering other habits in the lives of people.

This is my goal, to develop a keystone habit around a morning coding practice that can impact the way that I think and those with whom I engage through collaboration (or my writing).
